<p>Jena GRDDL Reader: Version 0.3</p>
<p>Note: also refer to the security conformance page that ships
in the doc directory of your version of the Jena GRDDL Reader.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The implementation of the security subsystem
of the Jena GRDDL Reader is guided by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/#sec">GRDDL Recommendation</a>.
However, this subsystem is incomplete.
This page, indicates which parts
of the security specification have been implemented,
and to what extent.
</p>
<p>
Security considerations when using the Jena GRDDL Reader
concern both the code itself, and the way in which the code is 
used. We start with things that the user of the code can do
to minimize risks.
</p>

<h2><a id="weaknesses" name="weaknesses"/>Some Limitations</h2>

<p>
A few key limitations of this software,
detailed below are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No protection against <a href="#dos">denial of service</a> attacks.</li>
<li>No commitment to <a href="#bugfix">timely bug fixes</a>.</li>
<li>Some of the <a href="#reads">permitted read operations</a> should, ideally, not be permitted.</li>
<li>No division of local and network resources into security domains, or
similar, is performed. Rather, read operations are permitted
during imports and includes processing, and for GRDDL operations,
and hopefully not otherwise. Such read operations, also allow writes
to untrusted servers, by means of the URLs used during the read 
operations.
</li>

<li>
The software has been <a href="#development">developed</a> almost exclusively
by one person, rather than by a multi-skilled team.</li>
<li>The security section of the specification was <a href="#drafting">initially drafted</a>
by that person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that GRDDL permits transforms to construct
URLs that are then retrieved. In this way, any data accessed
inappropriately can be transmitted to an untrusted server.
</p>

 
<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<h3>Reduced Privilege</h3>
<p>
The specification says:
</p>
<blockquote>
are more safely executed with the privileges associated with an untrusted party, 
rather than the current user
</blockquote>
<p>
When using the GRDDL Reader, it is best if the
process executing the code has as few privileges as possible.
In particular, the code should not run as the <code>root</code>
user under Unix. With other operating systems,
it is best to avoid running the code as a user with
administrator privileges.
</p>
<h3><a id="dos" name="dos"/>Denial of Service</h3>
<p>
The specification says:
</p>
<blockquote>
Software executing GRDDL transformations should provide appropriate mechanisms to abort processing after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. In addition, GRDDL software should be limited to the consumption of only a reasonable amount of any given system resource.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Jena GRDDL Reader does not implement such limitations.
Hence, any use of this library should provide
the end-user with the facility to interrupt. For example,
using ctrl-C on a command line, to terminate the Java process.
</p>
<h3><a id="bugfix" name="bugfix"/>Bug fixes</h3>
<p>The specifcation says:</p>
<blockquote>
bugs may exist in some interpreters of a transformation language which might be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a recipient's system. Apart from noting this possibility, no specific action is advised to take to prevent this aside from timely correction of such bugs as they are discovered
</blockquote>
<p>
HP does not offer support contracts for the Jena GRDDL Reader
and there is no commitment to timely correction of such bugs.
It may be possible to purchase a support contract for the Saxon
XSLT implementation. Please ask Saxonica Ltd.
</p>
<p>
The Jena GRDDL Reader currently has one engineer (Jeremy Carroll)
assigned, part-time, to its development and support.
There are no plans to increase this level of support.
Jeremy Carroll has many other responsibilities and commitments
that may detract from timely bug fixes to the GRDDL Reader.
</p>
<p>
As with all open source software, the final responsibility
for timely bug fixes lies with the user community, who have
access to the source code, to enable such fixes.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the end user needs to regularly check
for updates of the major components used in the Jena GRDDL Reader.
These include: Java, Jena, Saxon, and the Jena GRDDL Reader.
</p>
<p>
In particular, any Java bugfix release which is advised
as addressing security issues for applets, may be required
to fix security issues concerning the use of the Jena GRDDL Reader.
</p>
<h2>Partial Conformance Information</h2>
<p>
This section specifies the intent of the current version
of
the Jena GRDDL Reader in implementing the 
various security considerations raised in the specification.
</p>
<p>Of course, each of these intents may not be correctly
implemented.
Such bugs would probably leave security holes.
</p>
<h3>Overview: Saxon and Sandboxing</h3>
<p>
The Jena GRDDL Reader uses the Saxon XSLT processor.
Some facilities provided by Saxon are used to improve
the security, in particular 
<code>net.sf.saxon.FeatureKeys.ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS</code>
is set to <code>false</code>; and 
<code>
http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing</code>
is set to <code>true</code>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the Java <code>SecurityManager</code>
framework is used, so that each XSLT transform
is run on a separate thread, with reduced privileges.
Unfortunately, the author of this code (Jeremy Carroll),
had no experience of writing such sandboxing code, and
errors are to be expected.
</p>
<h3>Not 'off-the-shelf'</h3>
<blockquote>
advised to guard against simply sending GRDDL transformations to "off-the-shelf" interpreters.
</blockquote>
<p>
Secure processing options in Saxon are used.
</p>
<h3>Blocked dangerous URI Operations</h3>
<blockquote>
In particular, operations to read or write URLs are more safely executed with the privileges associated with an untrusted party, rather than the current user. 
</blockquote>
<p>
During execution of XSLT transforms,
nearly all URI operations are blocked by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling the use of the URI resolver.</li>
<li>Disabling the 
<code>&lt;xsl:result-document&gt;</code>
instruction</li>
<li>Disabling
the <code>unparsed-text</code>
and <code>unparsed-text-available</code>
functions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="reads" name="reads"/>Permitted dangerous URI operations</h3>
<p>A variety of read URI operations are permitted.</p>
<p>These may allow untrusted code to access
data that it should not be permitted to read.</p>
<p>These definitely allow untrusted code
to send any information accessed illegally back
to arbitrary servers on the Web.</p>
<p>
XSLT code is compiled separately from its execution.
During compilation <code>xsl:import</code>
and <code>xsl:include</code> are enabled.
No attempt is made to reduce the privileges of
such operations.
</p>
<p>
The XML documents being processed
may include references to other
URIs, for instance as external entity references,
or in an external DTD. In this release of the 
Jena GRDDL Reader, it is unclear whether or not
such operations are permitted. This may be clarified
in future releases.
</p>
<p>
The results of an XSLT transform are used
as GRDDL results, which include URIs that
are later dereferenced. No attempt is made
to reduce the privileges of such operations.
</p>
<h3>Extensions and Native Java</h3>
<blockquote>
Some transformation language implementations may provide facilities for loading and executing other programming language code.
...
software executing GRDDL transformations should protect against such operators
</blockquote>
<p>
and
</p>
<blockquote>
Software executing GRDDL transformations should make sure that extensions are secure and do not present any kind of threat.
</blockquote>
<p>
Most Saxon extensions to XSLT are switched off by using
the secure processing flag.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the use of the Java sandbox disables further
insecure operations, which remain enabled: for example
reading Java system properties.
</p>

<h2><a name="development" id="development"/>Other Risks</h2>

<h3><a name="development" id="development"/>Unreviewed Design and Code</h3>
<p>
Normal software development methodology
suggests that both the design of
the software and the code implementing
the design should be reviewed by
at least a  second person.
</p>
<p>
This has not been done for this version
of this software, which is almost exclusively
the work of Jeremy Carroll.
</p>
<h3><a name="drafting" id="drafting"/>Further Exposure to Errors in Carroll's Judgement</h3>
<p>
In addition, the author of this software,
also drafted the initial version of the
security aspects of the
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-grddl-20070302/#sec'>specification</a>.
This section has not had wide review.
This further exposes this software to errors in his judgement.
