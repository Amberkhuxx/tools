<h2>Some Specific Limitations of this Software</h2>

<p>
The Jena GRDDL Reader is an incomplete implementation
of an 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-grddl-20070302/">unfinished specification</a>.
An important area in which 
the implementation is incomplete concerns the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-grddl-20070302/#sec">
security section
</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few key limitations of this software,
detailed both on the Web and in the 
documentation (file: doc/security-conformance.html) which
ships with the software, are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No protection against <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/grddl/security-conformance.html#dos">denial of service</a> attacks.</li>
<li>No commitment to <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/grddl/security-conformance.html#bugfix">timely bug fixes</a>.</li>
<li>Some of the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/grddl/security-conformance.html#reads">permitted read operations</a> should, ideally, not be permitted.</li>
<li>
The software has been <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/grddl/security-conformance.html#development">developed</a> almost exclusively
by one person, rather than by a multi-skilled team.</li>
<li>The security section of the specification was <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/grddl/security-conformance.html#drafting">initially drafted</a>
by that person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that GRDDL permits transforms to construct
URLs that are then retrieved. In this way, any data accessed
inappropriately can be transmitted to an untrusted server.
</p>
<p>Of course, any bugs in the implementation
of the security features that have been implemented,
may result in more serious problems: these could include
writing to arbitrary files on your system, permitting
malicious code to take control of your system.
